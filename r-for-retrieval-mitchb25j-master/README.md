use cases?

in OOA2 group each classes attributes ad services with the class:

name: Stoplist
atts: 
  stopwords: collection of stopwords
services:
  buildStoplist: adds generic words such as “the” to stopword list
  isStopword: checks some word to see if it is a stopword


-Document
    -none
-Word
    -none

-- two red flags ... 
-- if a class provides the system with nothing more than building itself
-- then why include it?  perhaps it has other methods?
